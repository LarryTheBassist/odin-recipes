    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The process of making this American breakfast food is grueling and painstaking, so buckle up and let's get down
        to business!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable or grapeseed oil or nonstick baking spray, for greasing</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with
            parchment paper or foil and grease lightly with oil or baking spray</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 cup of the cornmeal with the sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Add the vanilla extract and 3/4 cup
            water, a little at a time, stirring until the batter is smooth and thin. If it's too dry, add additional
            water. You want something the consistency of pancake batter. </li>
        <li>Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread out evenly. (It won't reach the edges, but that's
            OK. You want a nice thin layer, about 1/4 to 1/3 inch thick.) </li>
        <li>Combine the remaining 1/2 cup cornmeal with 1 teaspoon water and mix until the mixture resembles coarse
            breadcrumbs; add an additional teaspoon or 2 of water, if too dry. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top of the batter with the cornmeal crumbs (this will help give it a little extra crunchy
            texture). </li>
        <li>Bake on the center rack, keeping a close eye on it, until the dough has dried out and cracked, 10 to 15
            minutes. You're looking for a cracked arid-desert landscape look to it. </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees F. Let the baking sheet cool, then use
            your hands to tear and crack the dough into small flakes. Return to the oven and bake on the center rack
            until the pieces are toasted, crisp, and golden, about 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let cool completely before serving with milk or as you would any cereal. Store leftovers in an airtight
            container in a cool dry place for up to 2 weeks. </li>
    </ol>
